URL Specification 
=================

This is the project page for a new [URL Specification][url-spec]. 

#ðŸŒ²

This [URL Specification][url-spec] is a _reverse specification_ and a generalisation of the [WHATWG URL Standard][wwg]. It aims to be fully 
compatible with the WHATWG standard, but in addition, it specifies elementary operations for **reference resolution** and it provides a **formal grammar**. 

A main goal of this project is to enable and support efforts towards a single **Unified URL Standard** that includes a normative specification of URL handling by web browsers and that resolves the incompatibilities between [RFC 3986][uri], [RFC 3987][iri] and the [WHATWG URL Standard][wwg]. 

This specification does not attempt to be such a unified URL standard itself. Instead it rephrases and generalises the WHATWG standard. This is a necessary intermediate step because the WHATWG standard is written in a style that makes it difficult to identify the differences between the specifications directly. It will be relatively simple to unify the standards once this work has been completed.
